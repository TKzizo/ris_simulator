DONE :
Ported calculations to use gonum/mat

TO BE DONE :
SNR for mimo case (Determinant calculation for complex matrices)
Add the clusters in the calculations
Add linear antenna support (Rotated RIS also?)
Add more antenna parameters(to be discussed)
Minor refractoring(Changing few structs and variables)(TO BE DISCUSSED)
